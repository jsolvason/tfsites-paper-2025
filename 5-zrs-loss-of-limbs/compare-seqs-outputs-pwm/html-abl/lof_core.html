        Notes: <br>
         - Scores for PWM are given without pseudocounts and with pseudocounts within parenthesis (e.g. 0.88 (0.91)) <br>
         - Kmers are not reported in the kmer plots which have the same sequence as wild-type <br>
         - Affinities reported as N.C. indicate that the dna sequence has no TF binding core sequence as specified by the user <br>
         - When binding site cores are provided without affinities, the affinity will be plotted in this report as "-" <br>
